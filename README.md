website url : http://18.222.158.111:3000/

Introduction:

This Single Page Application allows User's to Order Fresh Fish from the nearest Local Fishmonger and get it delivered right to your doorsteps.  

Languages Used: React,Nodejs and CSS.

These are some of the problems faced by the society and Along with How our project solves these problems:

1.	People will not get any notification when the fishmongers come near their house.Sometimes they will not be able to hear the fishmongers horn.
	Especially people living in appartments will not be able to hear their horn in 3rd floor or above.
	Our project allows the fishmonger to send notification to individual users when he is approaching the customer's locality,So that they will be 
	aware that the fishmonger will be coming soon.
	
2.	People working in 9 to 5 jobs will not be able to buy fish from the local fishmonger as he will be selling fish between 9 to 5.
	Our project allows customers to order fish in any given time(Depending on wether the local fishmonger is ready to deliver or not).
	
3.	In Mangalore City people wait for mobile fishmonger for hours,This is inefficient as they have to waste time waiting for the fishmonger when he is
	roaming around the house of the those people who are not buying fish.
	Our project saves time of the Customer as well as the Fishmonger as order will be placed by the customer and the 
	Fishmonger will be notified exactly where to deliver.
	
4.	Most of the fish gets wasted by the end of the day as the quality of fish degrades with time.By evening some quantity of fish will be wasted and Fishmonger 
	will be left with no other option but to throw those fish.
	In this case,Our project help both the Fishmongers as well as the Customer.The Mongers will post the clearance sale at the end of the day selling those fish 
	for considrably lower price,this helps the monger to sell those fish instead of wasting them and this also benifits the customer as they will save some money
	on their purchase.
	
5.	Improves the Business of the Local Mobile Fish Mongers.
	Our project increases the reachability of the Fishmongers to every corner of the city improving their business.It further helps the customer as
	they will be able to order fish from any corner of the city.
